                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Text Automata allows you to quickly generate text from a template.
                    You can create the markdown for a template using the tools on the <a href="index.html">template page</a> and generate the text from the template on the generate page (which can be reached by clicking the "next" button on the template page).
                    The tool is useful for dynamically generating text for repetitive tasks such as cover letters and applications.
                </p>

                <h2>Toggle</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Toggled text is text that you can include (toggle on) or exclude (toggle off).
                    It is represented in the markdown using square brackets <span class="toggle-text">[ ]</span>.
                    Here is an example of a template with two toggles:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">[that time works well!]</span><span class="toggle-text">[unfortunately, I won't be able to make it.]</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    There are two ways to create a toggle on the template page:<br><br>
                    1. Select/highlight the text you want to toggle in the main input section and click the toggle button.
                    NOTE: If you do not select or highlight any text before clicking the toggle button, the square brackets <span class="toggle-text">[ ]</span> will not appear.<br>
                    2. Type the '<span class="toggle-text">[</span>' and '<span class="toggle-text">]</span>' characters around the text you want to toggle.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    While stepping through the template on the generate page, you will be prompted to include or exclude each toggled segment.
                    By default, a toggled segment is included (toggled on) for visibility. 
                    Here is what you will see first for the template from the previous example:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">that time works well!</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    If you click the exclude button, the toggle will be crossed out:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text excluded-toggle">that time works well!</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    After you click the "next" button, the excluded toggle will disappear since it is not included in the final text and the next toggle will appear:
                </p>
                
                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, I won't be able to make it.</span>
                </p>

                <h2>Variable</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can type anything into variable text.
                    It is represented in the markdown using braces <span class="custom-text">{ }</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">{role}</span> at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    There are three ways to create a variable on the template page:<br><br>
                    1. Select/highlight the text you want to make into a variable and click the variable button.<br>
                    2. Type the '<span class="custom-text">{</span>' and '<span class="custom-text">}</span>' characters around the text you want to make into a custom prompt.<br>
                    3. Click the variable button, enter the variable name, and click finish.
                    NOTE: There is a character limit on the variable name length with the template user interface. 
                    If you want to use a longer variable name, you must manually enter the '<span class="custom-text">{</span>' and '<span class="custom-text">}</span>' characters around the variable name.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The generate page will sequentially prompt you to fill out the variables.
                    Here is what you will see first for the template from the previous example:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">role</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    By default, the prompt text is shown. 
                    You can type anything into the input box to overwrite the prompt.
                    After entering "frontend developer role" and selecting next, you will be prompted for the next variable.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">frontend developer role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    After entering "Text Automata" for the company, the final text will look like this:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">frontend developer role</span> at <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Here is another example of a sentence you can generate with the same template:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">keyboard designer position</span> at <span class="custom-text">Artemis Design Studios</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    If you have autofill turned on, the previous variable entry for the same prompt will be displayed instead of the prompt.
                    You can still change the variable entry by typing anything into the text input box.
                    Here is a template to demonstrate how autofill works:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I was excited when I saw the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                    I believe that my experience in <span class="custom-text">{experience}</span> will allow me to thrive at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You will be prompted for the company initially since there was no previous entry for company.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I was excited when I saw the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">company</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    After filling out the <span class="custom-text">company</span> entry as <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span> and the <span class="custom-text">experience</span> entry as <span class="custom-text">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span>, the second <span class="custom-text">company</span> prompt will be autofilled with <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I was excited when I saw the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span>.
                    I believe that my experience in <span class="custom-text">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span> will allow me to thrive at <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can still enter any text for the second <span class="custom-text">company</span> entry and override the <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span> suggestion.
                    You can turn autofill on or off by clicking the autofill button.
                </p>


                <h2>Nesting</h2>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can nest variables within toggles. Here is an example of valid nesting:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    <span class="nested-text">[As an avid follower of the <span class="custom-text">{industry}</span>, I was excited about the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.]</span>
                    <span class="nested-text">[While I am unfamiliar with the <span class="custom-text">{industry}</span> I believe my experience in  <span class="custom-text">{experience}</span> will allow me to thrive at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.]</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The toggle is evaluated before the nested variables. 
                    If you choose to exclude a nested toggle, you will not be prompted for the nested variables inside the toggle.
                    Instead, you will be prompted to make the next decision.
                </p>

                <h2>Escape Character</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can use the escape character '<span class="emphasized-text">\</span>' (backslash) to enter text that would otherwise be evaluated.
                    Here are some examples in a template:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    1. arr[0]<br>
                    2. arr\[0]<br>
                    3. Here is a \\
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Here is what the template evaluates to:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    1. arr<span class="toggle-text">0</span><br>
                    2. arr[0]<br>
                    3. Here is a \
                </p>

                <h2>Preview</h2>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The preview button on the template page allows you to preview how your text will be semantically parsed.
                    It displays the text without the parced braces or brackets while including colors (like the examples on this page) to display a preview of the parsing.
                </p>

                <h2>Import and Download</h2>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can import an existing template into the template page.
                    The preferred file format is .txt for imports but it works on other formats as well.
                    You can download the template and the generated text as .txt files.
