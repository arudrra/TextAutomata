                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The first step in the process is creating a text (.txt) template.
                    You can create the text template using the tools on the template page.
                    For example, consider the following sample template for a cover letter:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">

                <h2 id="tutorial-toggles">Toggles</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Toggled text is text that you can include (toggle on) or exclude (toggle off).
                    It is represented in the template using square brackets <span class="toggle-text">[ ]</span>.
                    Here is an example of a template with two toggles:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">[we are excited to offer you a position at Text Automata!]</span><span class="toggle-text">[unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.]</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    There are two ways to create a toggle on the template page:<br><br>
                    1. Select/highlight the text you want to toggle in the main input section and click the toggle button.
                    NOTE: If you do not select or highlight any text before clicking the toggle button, the square brackets <span class="toggle-text">[ ]</span> won't display.<br>
                    2. Type the '<span class="toggle-text">[</span>' and '<span class="toggle-text">]</span>' characters around the text you want to toggle.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    When the <span class="toggle-text">toggles</span> setting is set to On (default), Text Automata displays all toggled text whether or not the text is excluded. When the <span class="toggle-text">toggles</span> setting is set to Off, Text Automata displays only toggled content selected for inclusion.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">we are excited to offer you a position at Text Automata!</span><span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can exclude toggled content by clicking on the text. Text Automata strikes through excluded content:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text excluded-toggle">we are excited to offer you a position at Text Automata!</span><span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can hide all excluded (crossed-out) toggles by changing the page settings in the menu bar.
                </p>
                
                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.</span>
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-variables">Variables</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can type anything into variable text.
                    It is represented in the template using braces <span class="custom-text">{ }</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">{role}</span> at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    There are three ways to create a variable on the template page:<br><br>
                    1. Select/highlight the text you want to make into a variable and click the variable button.<br>
                    2. Type the '<span class="custom-text">{</span>' and '<span class="custom-text">}</span>' characters around the text you want to make into a custom prompt.<br>
                    3. Click the variable button, enter the variable name, and click finish.
                    NOTE: There is a character limit on the variable name length with the template user interface. 
                    If you want to use a longer variable name, you must manually select and/or enter the '<span class="custom-text">{</span>' and '<span class="custom-text">}</span>' characters around the variable name.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Here is what you will see first for the template from the previous example:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    By default, the prompt text is shown.
                    Click on the variable to edit it. 
                    Variables that you are currently editing will be <span class="emphasized-text">highlighted</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text emphasized-text">role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    By default, the prompt text is shown. 
                    You can type anything to overwrite the prompt.
                    You can create a new line by hitting enter.
                    Hit the Esc key to finish editing.
                    If you do not hit the Esc key after editing, you will not be able to edit other parts of the text.
                    To copy and paste text into a variable, use the legacy generator linked at the bottom of the template page.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">frontend developer role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Your final text after editing both variables will look like this:

                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">frontend developer role</span> at <span class="custom-text">Text Automata</span>.

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Here is another sentence you can generate with the same template:
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The autoapply setting assigns the same value to all variables with the same name.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I was excited when I saw the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                    I believe that my experience in <span class="custom-text">{experience}</span> will allow me to thrive at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    When you select company, all variables with the name <span class="custom-text">company</span> will be <span class="emphasized-text">highlighted</span>.

                <p class="example-text">

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can now edit both variables simultaneously:

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can turn off autoapply by clicking the autoapply button.
                    With autoapply turned off, you can overwrite the text for the second <span class="custom-text">company</span> entry.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can nest variables within toggles. Here is an example of valid nesting:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    <span class="nested-text">[As an avid follower of the <span class="custom-text">{industry}</span>, I was excited about the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.]</span>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    If you exclude and hide a nested toggle, the variables within the nested toggle will be hidden.
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-escape-character">Escape Character</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can use the escape character '<span class="emphasized-text">\</span>' (backslash) to enter text that would otherwise be evaluated.
                    Here are some examples in a template:

                <p class="example-text">

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The original Text Automata generator provided a step-by-step interface to edit each segment individually.
                    If you are concerned about forgetting variables or copying and pasting text, you may find the legacy generator more useful.
                    The legacy generator supports hidden toggles and autoapply (in the form of autofill) as well.
                    You can use the legacy generator by selecting the legacy button on the template page.

                    The preview button on the template page allows you to preview how your text will be semantically parsed.
                    It displays the text without the parsed braces or brackets while including colors (like the examples on this page) to display a preview of the parsing.

                    You can import an existing template into the template page.
                    The preferred file format is .txt for imports but it works with other formats as well.
                    You can download the template and the generated text as .txt files.
