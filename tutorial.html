                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Text Automata was initially developed as a command line tool to generate cover letters for job applications.
                    You can use it to dynamically generate text with highly repetitive content such as cover letters, large volume emails, college admissions essays, and more.
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The first step in the process is creating a (.txt) source template.
                    You can create the source template using the tools on the template page.
                    For example, consider the following source template for a cover letter:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">

                <h2 id="tutorial-toggles">Toggles</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Toggled text is text that you can include (toggle on) or exclude (toggle off).
                    You can define toggles in the source template using square brackets <span class="toggle-text">[ ]</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    The following is an example of a source template with two toggles:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">[we are excited to offer you a position at Text Automata!]</span><span class="toggle-text">[unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.]</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    There are two ways to create a toggle on the source template page:<br><br>
                    1. Select/highlight the text you want to toggle in the main input section and click the toggle button.
                    NOTE: If you do not select or highlight any text before clicking the toggle button, the square brackets <span class="toggle-text">[ ]</span> won't display.<br>
                    2. Type the '<span class="toggle-text">[</span>' and '<span class="toggle-text">]</span>' characters around the text you want to toggle.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    When the <span class="toggle-text">toggles</span> setting is set to show (default), Text Automata displays all toggled 
                    text in the generated template whether or not the text is excluded. When the <span class="toggle-text">toggles</span> 
                    setting is set to hide, Text Automata displays only toggled text selected for inclusion in the generated template.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    For example, the following template for the preceding example toggles displays both toggles because <span class="toggle-text">toggles</span> setting is set to show:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">we are excited to offer you a position at Text Automata!</span><span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can exclude a toggle by clicking on the text. Text Automata displays a strikethrough excluded toggles:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text excluded-toggle">we are excited to offer you a position at Text Automata!</span><span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can hide all excluded toggles by clicking the <span class="toggle-text">toggles</span> setting in the menubar. 
                    For example, the following shows the included toggle and hides the excluded toggle in the generated template:
                </p>
                
                <p class="example-text">
                    Hi, <span class="toggle-text">unfortunately, we will not be able to extend an offer at this time.</span>
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-variables">Variables</h2>
                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Variable text is text that you can dynamically replace in your generated template. If you define multiple instances of a variable 
                    in your template, you can replace all instances of the variable or selected instances of a variable in your generated template. 
                    You can define variables in the source template using braces <span class="custom-text">{ }</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    For example, consider the following example variables in a source template:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">{role}</span> at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can define a variable on the source template page in the following ways:<br><br>
                    1. Select the text you want to define as a variable and click the variable button.<br>
                    2. Type the '<span class="custom-text">{</span>' and '<span class="custom-text">}</span>' characters around the text 
                    you want to convert to a variable.<br>
                    3. Click the variable button, enter the variable name, and click finish.
                    NOTE: There is a character limit on the variable name length in the template user interface. 
                    If you want to use a longer variable name, you must use 1 or 2 above to convert the text to a variable.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    For example, the following shows the generated template for the preceding example variables:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>:
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Text Automata displays the variable name in the generated template.
                    To replace a variable, click the variable to edit it. Text Automata <span class="emphasized-text">highlights</span>
                    variables that you select for editing.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    For example, the following shows the variable role as <span class="emphasized-text">highlighted</span> for 
                    editing:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text emphasized-text">role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Text Automata allows you to enter any text as a replacement for a variable in the generated template. You can 
                    also use another variable name as a replacement text for a variable. 
                    To copy and paste text into a variable, use the legacy generator linked at the bottom of the template page.
                    You can create a new line by hitting enter.
                    Hit the Esc key to finish editing variables.
                    If you don't hit the Esc key after editing, you will not be able to edit other parts of the text.
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    For example, the following shows the replacement text for the <span class="custom-text">role</span> 
                    variable.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    I would like to apply for the <span class="custom-text">frontend developer role</span> at <span class="custom-text">company</span>.

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The following shows replacement text for both the <span class="custom-text">role</span> and 
                    <span class="custom-text">company</span> variables:
                </p>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Here is another sentence you can generate with the same template:

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The <span class="custom-text">autoapply</span> setting assigns the same value to all variables with the same name.
                    For example, consider the following source template with multiple instances of the company variable and one instance 
                    of the experience variable:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">

                <p class="tutorial-text">

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can nest variables within toggles. Here is an example of valid nesting:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    <span class="nested-text">[As an avid follower of the <span class="custom-text">{industry}</span>, I was excited about the opportunity at <span class="custom-text">{company}</span>.]</span>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    If you exclude and hide a nested toggle, Text Automata hides the variables within the nested toggle.

                    You can use the escape character '<span class="emphasized-text">\</span>' (backslash) to enter text that would otherwise be evaluated.
                    Here are some examples in a template:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    1. arr[0]<br>
                    2. arr\[0]<br>
                    3. Here is a \\

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    Here is what the template evaluates to:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                    1. arr<span class="toggle-text">0</span><br>
                    2. arr[0]<br>

                <h2 id="tutorial-legacy-generator">Legacy Generator</h2>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The original Text Automata generator provided a step-by-step interface to edit each segment individually.
                    If you are concerned about forgetting variables or copying and pasting text, you may find the legacy generator more useful.
                    The legacy generator supports hidden toggles and autoapply (in the form of autofill) as well.
                    You can use the legacy generator by selecting the legacy button on the template page.
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-preview">Preview</h2>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    The preview button on the template page allows you to preview how your text will be semantically parsed.
                    It displays the text without the parsed braces or brackets while including colors (like the examples on this page) to display a preview of the parsing.
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-imports-and-downloads">Import and Download</h2>

                <p class="tutorial-text">
                    You can import an existing template into the template page.
                    The preferred file format is .txt for imports.
                    You can download the template and the generated text as .txt files.
